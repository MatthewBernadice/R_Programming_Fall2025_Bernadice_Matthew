#1) Base R Graphics
#Create at least two plots using base R functions. Examples:
# Scatter plot
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl,
     main   = "Base:MPG vs. Cylinders",
     xlab   = "MPG",
     ylab   = "Cylinders")

# Histogram
hist(mtcars$wt,
     main   = "Base: Distribution of Vehicle Weight",
     xlab   = "Vehicle Weight")


#2) Lattice Graphics
#Use the lattice package to produce conditioned or multivariate plots. Examples:
library(lattice)

# Conditional scatter plot (small multiples)
xyplot(mpg ~ wt | factor(cyl),
       data = mtcars,
       main = "Lattice: MPG vs. Weight by Cylinders")

# Box-and-whisker plot
bwplot(mpg ~ factor(cyl),
       data = mtcars,
       main = "Lattice: MPG by category(Cylinder)")


#3) ggplot2
#Use ggplot2â€™s grammar of graphics to create layered visuals. Examples:
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot with smoothing
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "ggplot2: MPG vs. Weight with trend by group(Cylinder)")

# Faceted histogram
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl) +
  labs(title = "ggplot2: MPG distribution by Cylinders")
